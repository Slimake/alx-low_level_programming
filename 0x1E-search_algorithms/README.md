# Search Algorithms
A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. Linear, binary and hash search are types of search algorithm.
